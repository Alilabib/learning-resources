Interview Process
----
Here is what to expect in a Facebook interview for software engineers:
  
◈ Recruiter Pre-screen (20-30 mins) - Initial screening based on resume. Questions related to your professional experience, noteworthy projects, and accomplishments. No coding.
 
◈ Technical Phone Interview (45-60 mins) – You will solve a coding question using an online editor. Your interviewer might ask you a follow-up question or add constraints to the current problem. Common topics include data structures, algorithms, and time/space complexity.  
 
◈ Onsite Loop (4-5 interviews) - Coding, design, and behavioral questions.
 ➡ Ninja (coding, 2 interviews) – 1-2 coding questions solved on a whiteboard in 45 mins.
 ➡ Pirate (design, 2 interviews) – Collaborative discussion with the interviewer. Drawing on a whiteboard to solve a system design question. Junior engineers don't get any design interviews.
 ➡ Jedi (behavioral) Questions about your motivation, people interactions, challenges, and work ethics. 
 
◈ Lunch - It's not an interview. The interviewer will show you around and have lunch with you.
