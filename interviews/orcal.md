➡ Recruiter Pre-screen (30 mins) - Initial screening based on resume. Questions related to your past experience and accomplishments. No coding.
  
➡ Online Coding Challenge (60 mins) – You will solve a coding question through HackerRank or an online code editor.
 
➡ Onsite Loop (4-5 interviews) - Coding, design, and behavioral questions.
 ● 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 (2 interviews) – 1-2 coding questions solved on a whiteboard in 45 mins.
 ● 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 – Collaborative discussion with the interviewer. Drawing on a whiteboard to solve a system design question.
 ● 𝗛𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 (behavioral + design) – Deep-dive into your past projects and detailed discussion on your current work experience. Will include technical design discussion. 
 ● 𝗕𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿(𝗕𝗧) 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱: Similar to Amazon's Bar Raiser, an engineer or manager outside of the team will interview you. Mostly behavioral questions but can include a design question. Questions about your motivation, people interactions, challenges, and work ethic. Sample questions: Tell me about a time when you worked with someone whose personality was different from yours. While working on a team, how did you deal with a conflict?
