𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀
Here is what to expect in a Microsoft interview for Software Engineers (SDE):
 
➡ 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (45 mins) - Initial screening based on resume and background. Coding questions about data structures and algorithms.
➡ 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗵𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗼𝗿 𝗢𝗻𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 (90 mins) – Algorithm. You will be asked 2-4 coding questions related to data structures and algorithms to be solved within 90 mins. 
➡𝗢𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽 (4-5 interviews of one hour each) - Coding, design, and behavioral questions.

● Algorithms - Coding questions solved on a whiteboard.
● Design - Junior engineers will be asked Object Oriented Design questions, whereas senior engineers will be asked System Design questions.
● Behavioral questions related to your motivation, leadership, challenges, and how you have been resolving conflicts.

➡ 𝗟𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 - You will be taken to lunch halfway through your interviews. You'll be interviewed during lunch. Expect design or behavioral questions.
➡𝗔𝘀 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 (As-Ap) – Similar to Amazon's Bar Raiser, 'As-Ap' is a senior leader who has veto power over your hiring. Together, 'As-Ap' and the hiring manager make the final hiring decision. Based on your previous interviews, As-Ap can ask coding, design, or behavioral questions.
